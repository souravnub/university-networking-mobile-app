# Context

---

We need a UI framework that supports the development of a mobile app for both iOS and Android platforms, with a focus on reducing development time and cost.

# Options considered

---

-   React Native
-   Flutter
-   Swift (iOS) / Kotlin (Android)

# Decision

---

Option Chosen: **React Native**

React Native supports same codebase for both android and iOS platforms, reducing the time and cost that goes into development.

# Consequences

---

**Positive:**

A single codebase for both platforms simplifies development and reduces costs. The development team can focus on one technology stack.

**Negative:**

Performance might not be as optimal as native apps, and complex animations or platform-specific UI elements might be challenging.
